<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

**Endpoint:** `POST /users/login`

**Description:**  
Authenticate a user using their email and password. On a successful login, a server-side session is established and session cookie is set in the clientâ€™s browser

> [!TIP]
> Setting a `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` in `settings.py` will increase security even more

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "Examplepassword123"
}
```
`200 OK` *Successful authentication*

```json
{
  "detail": "Successfully logged in"
}
```

`400 Bad Request` *Invalid credentials provided (email or password)*

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

`403 Forbidden` *Account is not active (pending admin activation)*

```json
{
  "detail": "Your account needs to be activated by an admin"
}
```

If a user creates his account, verifies email and tries to log in API will return a 403 Forbidden response.

Cause:
The user's `is_active` status is set to `FALSE` in the database, preventing new *(unknown)* users from accessing map with bike locations

Fix:
Admin must manually activate the account by setting `is_active = TRUE` in the user management system.

  ```json
  {
    "email": "Email already exists"

## User Management Endpoints

<h2 id="parkings">Parkings Endpoints </h2>
Rental area can cover an entire country or even globe, but it is recommended to limit it to smaller regions, such as city. To enforce this, admins can define a special parking area called a "boundary".

This can be done by sending a <a href="create-parking">POST request</a> with the following data (coordinates should be adjusted to match your specific location):
 
  ```json
  {
  "name": "boundary",
  "geometry": { 
    "type": "Polygon", 
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [19.850, 50.100], 
        [19.950, 50.100], 
        [20.050, 50.050], 
        [19.950, 49.950], 
        [19.850, 49.950], 
        [19.850, 50.100]
      ]
    ] 
  }
  }
  ```

The geometry attribute follows the GEOJSON format, so make sure to familiarize yourself with GEOJSON documentation:
