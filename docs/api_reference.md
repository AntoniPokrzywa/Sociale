# API Reference Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to the API endpoints available in the app. It covers endpoints in users, bikes, parkings, and rentals including methods, query parameters and response formats.

## Authentication
**Endpoint:** `POST /users/login`

**Description:**  
Authenticate a user using their email and password. On a successful login, a server-side session is established and session cookie is set in the clientâ€™s browser

> [!TIP]
> Setting a `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` in `settings.py` will increase security even more

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "Examplepassword123"
}
```
`200 OK` *Successful authentication*

```json
{
  "detail": "Successfully logged in"
}
```

`400 Bad Request` *Invalid credentials provided (email or password)*

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

`403 Forbidden` *Account is not active (pending admin activation)*

```json
{
  "detail": "Your account needs to be activated by an admin"
}
```

If a user creates his account, verifies email and tries to log in API will return a 403 Forbidden response.

Cause:
The user's `is_active` status is set to `FALSE` in the database, preventing new *(unknown)* users from accessing map with bike locations

Fix:
Admin must manually activate the account by setting `is_active = TRUE` in the user management system.

## User Endpoints

### 1. Register User

**Endpoint:** `POST /users/register/`

**Description:**  
Create a new user account. After registration, the user must verify their email.
The server sends a mail with verification link formatted as `FRONTEND_URL/UID/TOKEN`. The frontend should parse it on its own.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "ExamplePassword123",
  "confirmed_password": "ExamplePassword123"
}
```

**Response:**

`201 Created` *Account created successfully; verification email sent*  
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Account created. Please verify your email."
  }
  ```

`400 Bad Request` *When user with provided email exists or passwords doesn't match*  
  ```json
  {
    "email": "Email already exists"
  }
  ```

`500 Internal Server Error` *Mail sending failed*  
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Mail sending failed"
  }
  ```

**Endpoint:** `PUT /users/reset-password-check/`

  "token": "reset-token",
  "password": "NewPassword123",

## User Management Endpoints

User Management system is only available for admins. In case a non privileged user ( with `is_staff=False` ) tries to fetch some data the access is denied and `403 Forbidden` status code is returned. In case you use django admin panel for management it might be a good idea to deactivate the endpoints below
